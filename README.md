# Dungeons-and-Towers
- The purpose of these repositories are to, firstly, serve as a place where I can easily store and access the files when needed; secondly, to document the game, its purpose, its members, along with what I learned from the project; and thirdly, to save the files just in case something happens to the original repository.

# Project Contributers:
- Mohammed Mirage
- Shardool Patel
- Harry Fu
- Saad Ali
- Liu Aiyuan
- Francis Bajamunde

# Description
The goal of this project was to learn proper software documentation, and to apply the Software Development Lifecycle to a programming project. In order to achieve this goal our group decided to design and program a Tower Defence game using Unity. Since Unity was the program of choice, our group used the C# programming language in order to implement our game.

# What I learned:
- How to create proper Software Documentation.
- How to apply the Software Development Lifecycle to a project.
- Unity Software and the C# Programming language.
- Game Design.
- How to brainstorm, design, and implement a project in a group setting.

# NOTE:
- If you want access to the files in the Private Repo, please contact me. Otherwise, the original GITLAB repository should contain the final Unity package.
